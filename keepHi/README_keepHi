This program is used to extract the highest weight edges in a .gml
file and create a new .gml file with these edges (nodes are the 
same as the original file). 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The usage can be found by typing 'keepHi' on the command line.  
It follows:

Usage:
  keepHi input.gml numNodes numEdgesOrig numEdgesKeep output.gml

where 

- 'input.gml' is the input file with weighted edges

- 'numNodes' is the number of nodes in 'input.gml'

- 'numEdgesOrig' is the number of edges in 'input.gml'

- 'numEdgesKeep' is the desired number of edges

- 'output.gml' is the output file in .gml format
