'split' is a program for randomly splitting rows of a file into two
files. This program can be used to prepare data for bootstrapping 
trials. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The usage can be found by typing 'split' on the command line.  
It follows:

Usage: split input.txt output1.txt output2.txt numberOfHeaderRows (numberOfLinesInOutput1)


where 

- 'input.txt' is your input data file

- 'output1.txt' and 'output2.txt' are the first and second output
  files, respectively

- 'numberOfHeaderRows' is number of header rows in input file (these
  will be printed to both output files)

- Optional: 'numberOfLinesInOutput1' can be specified in order to split
  the files into uneven sized files
