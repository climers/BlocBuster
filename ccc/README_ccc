README for ccc.

Release v1.0
June 2014
Sharlee Climer


'ccc' is a program for computing vector-based correlations between 
SNP alleles and outputting high correlations to a .gml file..  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The usage can be found by typing 'ccc' on the command line.  
It follows:

Fatal: Usage:

   ccc input.txt output.gml threshold numInd numSNPs numHeaderRows numHeadCols

where 

- 'input.txt' is your genotype data

- 'output.gml' is the output file in .gml format

- 'threshold' is the CCC threshold for creating an edge

- 'numInd' is the number of individuals

- 'numSNPs' is the number of SNPs

- 'numHeadRows' is the number of header rows in 'input.txt'

- 'numHeadCols' is the number of header columns in 'input.txt'

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'input.txt' file is your genotype data.  

- ccc accepts any number of header rows and/or header columns.

- The genotypes can be in any of the following formats:
	AT
	A/T
	A T
  where there is a single space between alleles in the third option.

- Other than the single space of the third option above, all white
  space (space, multiple spaces, tab, newline) are treated the same.

- Accepted characters include: A, C, G, T, D, I, N, NA, NN, 0 (zero), 
  where N, NA, NN, and zero represent missing data. (D and I can be 
  used to represent deletions and insertions.)

- User can specify a custom missing symbol in 'bloc.h'.

- If each row represents a SNP (e.g. HapMap format), set ROWS_R_SNPS 
  in 'bloc.h' to 1.  If each column represents a SNP (e.g. Plink 
  format) set this value to 0. 

*** Important note about input file: ***

- Each string in the header rows and/or columns must be continuous
  with no internal white space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'output.gml' file is the output file in .gml format.

Some notes about this format:

- Can have comments at beginning of file (number of nodes, etc.).
  Blocbuster will output one comment line: 'Graph with x nodes.'

- The word 'graph' followed by '[' starts actual listing of the 
  graph nodes and edges.

- Nodes are listed first, followed by edges.  Brackets are placed
  in particular locations, as in the following example (variations 
  of white space doesn't matter).

- The 'node', 'id', 'edge', 'source', and 'target' are listed.

- The 'weight' field is optional.  BlocBuster will provide the 
  relevant CCC value for the weight.  (If SNP graph is created, the
  maximum CCC value will be the weight.)

Example:

Graph with 4 nodes. 
graph
[
        node 
        [
        id 1 
        ]
        node 
        [
        id 2 
        ]
        node 
        [
        id 3 
        ]
        node 
        [
        id 4 
        ]
        edge
        [
        source 1
        target 2
        weight 0.065000
        ]
        edge
        [
        source 1
        target 4
        weight 0.036111
        ]
        edge
        [
        source 3
        target 2
        weight 0.140000
        ]
        edge
        [
        source 3
        target 4
        weight 0.077778
        ]
]

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If LOG_FILE is set to 1 in bloc.h, a log file with the same name 
as the output file (minus the '.gml' plus '.bloc.log' appended) will
record the screen output, except warnings and fatal messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to run ccc in the background, use:

  nohup ccc input.txt output.gml threshold numInd numSNPs numHeadRows
      numHeadCols  >& trialName.screen &

---------------------------------------------------------------------

ccc will terminate if too many edges are output.  This value 
can be adjusted by changing MAX_NUM_EDGES in 'bloc.h'.  Default value
is one million edges.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

An example file is included and can be used as a test by typing:

./ccc example_10indiv_6snp.txt temp.gml 0.7 10 6 1 1

The file 'temp.gml' should match 'check.gml' and hold a single edge
from source 11 to target 12 with weight of 0.748.
